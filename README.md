# go-mpd-discplayer

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/b0bbywan/go-mpd-discplayer.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/b0bbywan/go-mpd-discplayer)

`mpd-discplayer` is a Go-based client designed for seamless integration with MPD (Music Player Daemon). It automates disc and USB playback by generating CUE files for audio discs and managing removable media. It also handles disconnections gracefully and provides configurable audio notifications.

## Features

- **Automated Audio Disc Playback:** Detects and plays inserted audio discs using `go-disc-cuer` for CUE file generation.
- **USB Media Playback:** Monitors removable USB drives and plays media files on the MPD server.
- **Robust Reconnection Logic:** Automatically reconnects to the MPD server if the connection is lost.
- **Flexible Configuration:** Supports configuration via YAML files or environment variables.
- **Audio Notifications:** Plays sound notifications for device events (insertion, removal) and critical errors.

## Installation

To use `mpd-discplayer`, you'll need to have Go installed on your system. If you donâ€™t have Go installed, follow the instructions at [https://golang.org/doc/install](https://golang.org/doc/install).

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/b0bbywan/go-mpd-discplayer.git
cd go-mpd-discplayer
```

### Install Prerequisites
Additional libraries are required at runtime. Dev libraries are required only to compile the project. Run the following commands based on your OS:

```bash
# Debian
sudo apt install \
	libcdparanoia0 \
	libdiscid0 \
	libgudev-1.0-0 \
	libdiscid-dev \
	libgudev-1.0-dev \
	libasound2-dev

# Fedora
sudo dnf install \
	cdparanoia-libs \
	libdiscid \
	libgudev \
	libdiscid-devel \
	libgudev-devel \
	alsa-lib-devel
```

### Build the Project
```bash
go build -o mpd-discplayer
```

## Usage

Once installed, `mpd-discplayer` automatically detects devices and interacts with the MPD server. Run the following command to start:

```bash
./mpd-discplayer
```

### Using Systemd (Optional)
To run mpd-discplayer as a systemd service:

```bash
sudo cp share/mpd-discplayer.service /usr/lib/systemd/user/
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable mpd-discplayer # enable on user login
systemctl --user start mpd-discplayer
```

## MPD Configuration
- To enable MPD-Discplayer some configuration is necessary :
	- It's recommended to run mpd and mpd-discplayer with the same user:
		- MPD-Discplayer needs to be able to write in MPD music_directory (at least in `MPDCueSubfolder`  for cue file storage and `MPDUSBSubfolder` for `symlink` mounting.
		- MPD also needs to be able to read files and directories created by MPD-Discplayer
	- **Disc Plyback**:
		- `input { plugin "cdio_paranoia" }`: allow MPD to play audio disc
		- `playlist_plugin { name "cue" enabled "true" as_folder "true" }`: allow audio disc covers display in MPD clients
	- **USB Playback**: Those settings are only necessary if using `mpd` mounting, `symlink` mounting doesn't need it.
		- `neighbors { plugin "udisks" }`: Enable udisk mounting MPD feature
		- `database { plugin "simple" path "~/.local/share/mpd/db" cache_directory "~/.local/share/mpd/cache" }`: Mandatory with neighbors plugins. Old `db_file` setting won't work with neighbors plugins

## Configuration

`mpd-discplayer` can be configured using a YAML configuration file or environment variables. This allows flexibility in managing settings for both the MPD server connection and the `disc-cuer` tool. Below is a detailed explanation of the configuration options and how to use them.
Visit [go-disc-cuer](https://github.com/b0bbywan/go-disc-cuer/) for more informations

### Configuration File

The configuration file is expected in one of the following locations:
1. `/etc/mpd-discplayer/config.yml` (system-wide configuration)
2. `~/.config/mpd-discplayer/config.yml` (user-specific configuration)

The file should be written in YAML format, and a sample structure is shown below:

```yaml
gnuHelloEmail: "your-email@example.com"
gnuDbUrl: "https://gnudb.gnudb.org"

MPDConnection:
  Type: "tcp"
  Address: "127.0.0.1:6600"
  ReconnectWait: 30
MPDLibraryFolder: "/var/lib/mpd/music"
DiscSpeed: 12
SoundsLocation: "/usr/local/share/mpd-discplayer"
AudioBackend: "pulse"
PulseServer: ""
MountConfig: "mpd"
MPDCueSubfolder: ".disc-cuer"
MPDUSBSubfolder: ".udisks"

```

#### MPD Connection Options
Under the MPDConnection key, you configure how mpd-discplayer connects to the MPD server:

- **Type**:
The type of connection to use. Supported values:
	- `"unix"`: For a Unix socket connection *(recommended as it enables MPD music_directory self discovery to set the directory for cue file and USB symlink mounting)*
	- `"tcp"`: For a TCP connection over the network. (default)

- **Address**:
	- For Type: `"unix"`, this is the path to the MPD socket file (e.g., `/var/run/mpd/socket` ) *(recommended)*.
	- For Type: `"tcp"`, this is the <hostname>:<port> of the MPD server (e.g., `127.0.0.1:6600`) *(default)*. *(Even though remote MPD server are supported, they won't work without additional setup not covered in this documentation)*


#### Notifications Options
- **AudioBackend**: `"pulse"` *(default)*, `"alsa"` or `"none` (disable notifications).
- **PulseServer**: Check [Pulseaudio Server String doc](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/Documentation/User/ServerStrings/)
- **SoundsLocation**: `"/usr/local/share/mpd-discplayer"` *(default)*. No default sounds are provided at the moment. Notifications expect `in.mp3`, `out.mp3` and `error.mp3` to be present in the specified folder or notifications will be disabled.

#### Mouting Options
For USB stick support, the content of the stick must be made available in MPD database. MPD-Discplayer supports the native mpd mouting feature, or symlinks for MPD servers that do not support this feature.
- **MountConfig**:
	- `mpd`
	- `symlink`
- **MPDLibraryFolder**: path to MPD music_directory *(self discovered when using MPD unix socket)*
- **MPDUSBSubfolder**: path inside `MPDLibraryFolder` to store symlinks to usb original mountpoints. Only with `MountConfig: "symlink"`, not used with `MountConfig: "mpd"`

### Environment Variables

If a configuration file is not provided, you can use environment variables to set the same options. Below is the list of supported variables and their defaults (if applicable):

| Environment Variable           | YAML equivalent                          | Default Value                  |

| `MPD_DISCPLAYER_MPDLIBRARYFOLDER` | `MPDLibraryFolder` | `/var/lib/mpd/music` |
| `MPD_DISCPLAYER_DISCSPEED` | `DiscSpeed` | `12` |
| `MPD_DISCPLAYER_SOUNDSLOCATION` | `SoundsLocation` | `/usr/local/share/mpd-discplayer` |
| `MPD_DISCPLAYER_AUDIOBACKEND` | `AudioBackend` | `pulse` |
| `MPD_DISCPLAYER_PULSESERVER` | `PulseServer` | *(Default to `""`, e.g. local pulseaudio unix socket)* | `MPD_DISCPLAYER_MOUNTCONFIG` | `MountConfig` | `mpd`
| `MPD_DISCPLAYER_MPDCUESUBFOLDER` | `MPDCueSubfolder` | `.disc-cuer` |
| `MPD_DISCPLAYER_MPDUSBSUBFOLDER` | `MPDUSBSubfolder` | `.udisks`

#### Priority of Configuration
The configuration is loaded in the following order of priority:
- Environment variables (highest priority)
- User-specific configuration file (~/.config/mpd-discplayer/config.yml)
- System-wide configuration file (/etc/mpd-discplayer/config.yml)
